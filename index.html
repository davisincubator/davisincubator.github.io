    <p>We are a collection of Psychology and Neuroscience graduate students who
    are interested in data science, user experience, and local beer. Our shared
    goal is to help each other prepare for a life (i.e. job) outside of academia,
    or perhaps take a more modern approach to one inside. You can read the latest
    blog post to the left, find older posts in the [archive]("/blog/"), or check
    out some of our [projects]("/projects/").</p>
