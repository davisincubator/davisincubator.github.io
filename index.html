    <p>We are a collection of Psychology and Neuroscience graduate students
    from <a href="http://ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">UC Davis</a> who are interested in data science, user experience, and local beer. Our shared
    goal is to help each other prepare for a life (i.e. job) outside of academia,
    or perhaps, take a more modern approach to a life inside. You can read the latest
    blog post to the left, find older posts in the <a href="blog/">archive</a>, or check
    out some of our <a href="projects/">projects</a>.</p>
