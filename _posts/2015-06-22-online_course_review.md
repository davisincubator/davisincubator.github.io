# My thoughts on an online intro computer science course

Recently I wrapped up [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com/) 
[Intro to Computer Science Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101), 
and I thought I would share my thoughts 
with hope that the information might be helpful to others who 
are considering which online courses to take.

I chose this course because I felt that I needed a little bit 
more practice with python before starting the [Data Science Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-science--ud359).
Previously, I had taken [Code Academy's](www.codeacademy.com) [python](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python) course, 
which was a good start but ultimately I found it a little lacking for my needs.
I didn't participate "fully" in the Udacity course (in that I did not pay for full access-- side effect of a grad student income I suppose!). I did watch the lectures and complete the quizzes and problem sets.
Overall, I'm really glad that I went through the course materials, and I feel that I was able to learn a lot even without full access.

##Pros: 
I liked that a number of the quizzes required a **conceptual understanding** of the material, rather than only requiring a script to execute successfully.
I also liked the depth/breadth balance of the material that was covered. 
I was able to practice and better understand what I had learned from the Code Academy course, and I also learned new information.
Another pro, and reason why I chose to follow this course rather than one from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), was that it was available on demand.

##Cons: 
I was expecting a little more of what I imagined would be covered in an intro course for computer science majors. Granted, 
I have never been a computer science major, nor have I taken such a class, so the problem could be more with my expectations. 
Regardless, my ideal course would have gone into more conceptual computer science, independent of python.

##Summary: 
Given that my goal was to build on my basic understanding of python, I feel like this course was absolutely worth my time. I can't say that, looking back, I would have greatly benefited from (paid) full access features.
