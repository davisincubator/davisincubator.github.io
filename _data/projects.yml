  description: "Chooseeats compares the check-in and ratings history hidden in
  the [foursquare](www.foursquare.com) and [swarm](www.swarmapp.com) accounts of
   you and your potential dining partner. It finds restaurant types (Chinese
   food, Italian, etc) that both people have liked and displays them in order
   with the length of time since you've checked in to that type."
